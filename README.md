# Image augmentation with AugLy
Repository with Google Colab Notebook using AugLy for image augmentation.
This notebook contains a set of selected functions used to generate more data for my thesis project. The purpose of the notebook is to give the user an idea of how to use the AugLy library and how to interact with Google Drive to store the images to augmentate. 

For more information about AugLy library, please visit the [AugLy repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AugLy).

This notebook has been made with only research and academic pourpuses.
